### Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 15 of Code 201, students will:

- Have an understanding of the fundamentals of Code 301 topics, as measured by observations from the instructional staff during class discussion.
- Have an understanding of how to successfully integrate Git and GitHub into a team code project, as measured by successful completion of the final project.
- Be grouped into project teams with a description of the project the team is going to build during Project Week given instruction from the instructor.

## 301 Preview

Preview of the topics in Code 301, and some over-arching 'how the web works' discussion.

### Structure of 301

- Frequent pair programming
- Code Challenges
  - 'write a function that takes in two arguments, a number and a name, and returns an object with name and number as properties'
  - lot's of array methods and string methods built in to JS
- 3 modules + project week
  - Code 301 begins with front end development using React and Bootstrap. Module 2 introduces the back-end and building servers to serve files to a React front-end. Module 3 brings everything together with the development of a full-stack application from start to finish. The final module is team-based project work.
- MERN - mongo(db), Express Server, React front end, Node

### Concepts in 301

- Collaboratively design and create web applications from scratch using MVC architecture built with professional-grade HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Work with string, array, and object data structures and algorithms to solve code challenges with pure JavaScript programming.
- Design dynamic front end and back end applications which can function together or independently and are deployed to cloud platforms.
- Explain the fundamentals of how the World Wide Web works, over the internet.
- Utilize dependency management techniques to build with third-party libraries such as ExpressJS, React, and Bootstrap.
- Persist data Mongo databases, sourced from third-party API or user-generated content.
- Follow agile software development practices during week-long sprints, including pair-programming, stand-ups, daily retrospectives, project management with Kanban boards, regular refactoring, and working in a shared code base.


## Final Project Overview

- Go over the final project description
- Discuss GitHub workflow in teams
- GitHub Issues & Projects are the best way to organize your project work
